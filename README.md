# Ribscan
Scan paper documents to a single PDF and attach to a new Thunderbird email message

Ribscan was created for the narrow purpose of 1-click scanning using the [NAPS2](https://www.naps2.com/) console and attaching the resulting PDF to a [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) email.  It may also be of use for getting started with [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) or as skeleton code to kickstart your own PyQt creation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* An available network or USB scanner
* A working installation of NAPS2 (the last-used profile will be used by default)
* A working email account in Thunderbird
* Python 3
* PyQt5

### Installing

Simply extract the project files into a folder of your choice:

```
Click the "Clone or download" button and select "Download ZIP"
```

Alternatively you can use git clone or svn checkout commands using the web URL:

```
git clone https://github.com/avlogue/ribscan.git
```

Run the 'ribscan.py' file by double-clicking it or running the command `python ribscan.py`.  On Windows systems you can add a 'w' to the end of the filename to avoid the black command window from popping up.
